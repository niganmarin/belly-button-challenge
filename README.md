### Belly Button Biodiversity

Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard! This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the fascinating world of microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset used for this project comes from the Belly Button Biodiversity study conducted by the Rob Dunn Lab.

Dataset Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset provides insights into the microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), present in human navels. The study reveals that a small handful of microbial species were found in more than 70% of individuals, while the remaining species were relatively rare.
